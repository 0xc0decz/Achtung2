# RimWorld-Achtung-Mod
Command your colonists like a boss!

With your colonists selected, use right-click and drag to distribute all selected colonists along a line. They get drafted automatically. 10 colonists + 10 doors in a row? No problem! 

How to: 

1) Install Community Core Library (from Steam or via https://github.com/RimWorldCCLTeam/CommunityCoreLibrary) 
2) Select at least one colonist 
3) Achtung! Will not activate with a single colonist. Override this with the alt-key. 
4) Use the right mouse button to drag along the map to distribute selected colonists 
5) Colonists that are not drafted become automatically drafted. Hold shift-key to not auto-draft. 

Have fun!
